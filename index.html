            <h2 class="steps__title">Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>Adjust the oven rack to the lower-middle position and preheat oven to 350°F (177°C).</li>
              <li> <strong> Make the crust:</strong> Using a food processor, pulse the graham crackers into crumbs. Pour
                into a medium bowl
                and stir in sugar
                and melted butter until combined. (You can also pulse it all together in the food processor.) Mixture
                will
                be sandy.
                Press firmly into the bottom and slightly up the sides of a 9-inch or 10-inch springform pan. No need to
                grease the pan
                first. I use the bottom of a measuring cup to pack the crust down tightly. Pre-bake for 8 minutes.
                Remove
                from the oven
                and place the hot pan on a large piece of aluminum foil. The foil will wrap around the pan for the water
                bath in step 4.
                Allow crust to slightly cool as you prepare the filling.</li>
              <li> <strong> Make the filling:</strong> Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment,
                beat the cream
                cheese
                and granulated
                sugar together on medium-high speed in a large bowl until the mixture is smooth and creamy, about 2
                minutes. Add the
                sour cream, vanilla extract, and lemon juice then beat until fully combined. On medium speed, add the
                eggs
                one at a
                time, beating after each addition until just blended. After the final egg is incorporated into the
                batter,
                stop mixing.
                To help prevent the cheesecake from deflating and cracking as it cools, avoid over-mixing the batter as
                best you can.</li>
              <li><strong> Prepare the simple water bath (see note)</strong> Boil a pot of water. You need 1 inch of
                water in your
                roasting
                pan for the
                water bath, so make sure you boil enough. I use an entire kettle of hot water. As the water is heating
                up,
                wrap the
                aluminum foil around the springform pan. Pour the cheesecake batter on top of the crust. Use a rubber
                spatula or spoon
                to smooth it into an even layer. Place the pan inside of a large roasting pan. Carefully pour the hot
                water inside of
                the pan and place in the oven. (Or you can place the roasting pan in the oven first, then pour the hot
                water in.
                Whichever is easier for you.)</li>
              <li>Bake cheesecake for 55-70 minutes or until the center is almost set. When it’s done, the center of the
                cheesecake will
                slightly wobble if you gently shake the pan. Turn the oven off and open the oven door slightly. Let the
                cheesecake sit
                in the oven in the water bath as it cools down for 1 hour. Remove from the oven and water bath, then
                cool
                cheesecake
                completely at room temperature. Then refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 4 hours or overnight.</li>
              <li>Use a knife to loosen the chilled cheesecake from the rim of the springform pan, then remove the rim.
                Using a clean
                sharp knife, cut into slices for serving. For neat slices, wipe the knife clean and dip into warm water
                between each
                slice.</li>
              <li>Serve cheesecake with desired toppings. Cover and store leftover cheesecake in the refrigerator for up
                to 5 days.</li>
